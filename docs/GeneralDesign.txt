Editor Design
#############

I would like two things to be visualizable and editable in VGSE:

	Story Structure Information and dialogue/event trees




Story Structure Data
####################

Story Structure Information is all the general information about story. This consists of:

## Narrative ()
## Research & Design
## Notes


I thought of some diagrams that this could be broken up into (This could use further research):

## Plot Mountain

	A "plot mountain" graph labeled with events from user's
	story. This would be used to organize:
		
		## Characters, Setting, Conflict
		## Plot events

## Passage

	A passage on a specific topic, such as characters, settings,
	research events, etc.


## Works Cited

	A quick place for citations.


## Notes

	unorganized notes, which user may desire to expand on
	later.




Dialogue Trees
##############

Dialogue Trees are the structures that hold game-ready dialogue. They should be highly editable, and I would like to present different formats for editing them.

There are a few features that I would like dialogue trees to contain:

## Easy event-branch implimentation

	I want all dialogue paths that involve triggering in-game events
	to have an easy way of triggering such events. Users should by
	no means have to revisit their story files after editing in
	vgse.


## Multiple ways of editing

	Since script-writing is traditionally non-graphical I would like
	to provide a text-based editor, as well as a visual editor, to
	write stories in.


## Easy to use, intuitive design

	I've thought about this one. :)
	
	vgse data should be presented schrewdly. Other editors suffer
	from lots of upfront data, and non-intuitive bindings (albiet,
	this is a part of software creating, I understand). But I've
	been thinking of different ways to cut through some of this
	chaos.
